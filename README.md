# Notes

Following the React tutorial - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMknfKXIFA8 React Course - Beginner's Tutorial for React JavaScript Library [2022]. I embarked on one of the side projects which was to create a personal travel journal focusing on making cards with props. These are some real places I've travelled to so it was really fun to make this.

Use 'npm start' to run it.
